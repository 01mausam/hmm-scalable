HTK - Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) [for speech recognition/synthesis, handwriting, and DNA sequencing] http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/
HMM for Matlab - http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html + literature

== HMM todo ==
- step tolerance == convergence tolerance, BEWARE! when conv tolerance grows
- check whether AIC and BIC computed correctly (n.parameters in particular)
- remove ->cut!=0 as blocking for computing gradient
- Revisit all fitting algorithms in order to optimize repetitive calls to get pO|model for stepping etc.
- Recycle should be called after computeAlpha… in gradient it's already called (check)

- for RMSE and LL, no need to re-read data and waste space for K*G*nO for pL
- make all loglik and RMSE computation more efficient

- striped data  - destructive read, if beyond certain border, delete previous

- Gradient Descent - is not tested with fitting as one skill first
- Baum Welch - does not have fitting of as one skill first
- Baum Welch - does not have selective fitting of PI,A,B
- All other steppers/fitters (Barzalai Borwein, LevinsonRabiner…, Exponentiated etc.) are not updated properly.
- algorithm is a parameter for predicthmm
	- reading model files should be done by problem object
- abstract class should be created or all methods should have standard signatures

== Assumptions ==
- columns: observation, user, step, skill[, opportunity]

=== ds445 ===
- 0.450512,  - basic by-skill (LevinsonRabinerSondhi1982 step)
- 0.450712,  - basic by-skill (Exponentiated step, exp takes to Inf sometimes :( )
- 0.454851 - basic by-skill (Linear step, log10 scale all together)
- 0.454927 - basic by-skill (Linear step, log10 scale separately)
== ds392 ==
- 0.243803 - t 0.01,   basic (LevinsonRabinerSondhi Step) 
- 0.244872 - t 0.01,   basic (Linear Step) 
- 0.24387  - t 0.001,  basic (Linear Step) 
- 0.243866 - t 0.0001, basic (Linear Step) 
- 0.262217 - t 0.01,   basic (Baum&Welch Step) 


== working with files ==


== GGordon ==GraphLab Carlos CS CMU - parallel
- Tinkerers, less flex than R bit more
- DataShop access to data
- potential clients: Ken, John, Phil, Emma, 
- get hub, sourceforge - repositories, search there
- Uncertainty in AI mail list
