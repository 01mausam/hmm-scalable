HTK - Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) [for speech recognition/synthesis, handwriting, and DNA sequencing] http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/
HMM for Matlab - http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html + literature

== HMM todo ==
- Collapse all gradient descent to one class with "switchers" for per-student and
    per-skill attributes
- add per-item (problem) effects
- step tolerance == convergence tolerance, BEWARE! when conv tolerance grows
- check whether AIC and BIC computed correctly (n.parameters in particular)

- (?) striped data  - destructive read, if beyond certain border, delete previous

- Baum Welch - does not have fitting of as one skill first
- Baum Welch - does not have selective fitting of PI,A,B
- All other steppers/fitters (Barzalai Borwein, LevinsonRabiner, Exponentiated etc.) are not updated properly.

== Assumptions ==
- columns: observation, user, step, skill[, time in ms]


== GGordon ==GraphLab Carlos CS CMU - parallel
- Tinkerers, less flex than R bit more
- DataShop access to data
- potential clients: Ken, John, Phil, Emma, 
- git hub, sourceforge - repositories, search there
- Uncertainty in AI mail list
